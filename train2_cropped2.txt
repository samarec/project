comp.sys.mac.hardware	re nutek faces apple s wrath article read in article davea davea xetron com david p alverson writes i believe apple has a patent on the region features of quickdraw a mac clone would have to implement regions this is why apple s comment was that they believe it is not possible to make a mac clone without infringing on their patents they may have other patents like this apple has patented their implementation of regions which presumably includes the internal data structure which has never been officially documented by apple apple cannot patent the concept of a region i m guessing that either nutek reverse engineered apple s internal data structure for regions i dunno if this would hold up in court or they came up with their own data structure if it s the latter then they won t be able to draw pict files containing regions besides pict files there aren t many places where regions are stored on disk quicktime movies perhaps as long as the region isn t being stored on disk and transferred from a mac to a nutek clone or vice versa it doesn t matter if nutek uses a completely different internal data structure i remember reading that apple also has a patent on their adb hardware and that the nutek clones would therefore be lacking an adb port what other patents does apple have on the mac joe schwartz e mail xor acm rpi edu or xor clotho acm rpi edu mapinfo corp broadway these are my own opinions any similarity to the troy ny opinions of mapinfo corporation is purely coincidental

comp.sys.mac.hardware	disappointed by la cie approximately four months ago i purchased a quantum lps hd from la cie for after two months the drive started having problems first there were intermittent freezes then corrupted files and resources then silverlining wouldn t even recognize the drive so i got an rma from la cie and exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one well about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems often when i boot up my iisi i get the flashing question mark sometimes if i then insert the silverlining program i can get it to recognize the drive by making it scan over and over for drives at that point i can restart the iisi and boot from the hd i ve called la cie again and they ve given me another rma their tech support people tell me that if silverlining doesn t see the drive there s a definite hardware problem given that this is the second bad drive in four months i asked la cie to send me a new one but they said no also within three weeks after i purchased my original drive la cie dropped the price on it by over i can accept that a drive or two may be bad and i know that hardware vendors make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs and i understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden price fluctuations nevertheless taken together the convergence of these facts events have left a bad taste in my mouth i should have added above that when i asked la cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one they will send i think the data is still in good shape and i ll have to again reinstall everything from floppies they said it would cost me for data recovery it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a discounted price and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still covered under a day warranty should be new i feel a little helpless about all this i don t mean to necessarily flame la cie their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful but c mon sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way i sent a letter to la cie s customer service when the first drive was returned and i asked them for a credit on the price difference since i had purchased the drive three weeks before they slashed the price i told them i would like to apply the credit toward the purchase of another la cie product they didn t even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other what s the moral of this story i m not sure but i do know i won t buy any other products from la cie in the future bill krauthammer f ehg umiami ir miami edu ps please don t email or post about how good your la cie product and service has been i m not suggesting that they are not a good company or anything like that all i m saying is that i ve had a disappointing experience with them and i ll be taking my business elsewhere in the future

uoknor edu james p callison writes in article apr michael apple com ems michael apple com e michael smith writes does it take any peculiar tools to remove the rear springs from a ford f truck this is a x with leaf springs front and rear so with a big socket and an air wrench and a floor jack and a hydrolic bottle jack can i do this at home i found that i needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks and a can of wd helped the sockets needed were metric exact fit but i was able to use some sae sockets and are rather close to and mm it can be fun having a canadian ford i m pictureing this undo u bolts put a bottle jack on the axle and raise the bed frame to take stress off of the leaf spring undo the end bolts bushings drop the spring turn the bottom leaf re connect the spring bolts sounds about right didn t have to undo the end bolts bushings just the u bolts on each side and the shock absorber jacking up the frame some more had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden platform on top of that to get the floor jack high enough to raise the frame i t one talll truck lifted the spring free of the axel taking out the block gave me enough room to undo the pin holding the spring pack together the spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head on the other end no wrench head vice grips worked fine i soaked the nut with wd and it came right off flipped the bottom spring and then is this a nightmare waiting to happen or an easy though physically demanding thing to do well it s easier than doing a decent trigger job on a a ok well maybe it s not that easy but it s not terribly difficult i donno i m a little more sore today than after working on a a a foot pipe cheater was a real help torque spec for the u bolt nuts is to ft lbs a a doesn t have that kind of torque spec it was a challenge to get the pack bolt back in the spring pack squeeze pack with two hands hold bolt with third put nut on with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth and sixth hands i used some string to tie the pack together while holding the pin in for alignment then i could let go to get the nut wrench vice grips getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too until i discovered that the axel had tilted and or rolled forward one the drivers side a bottle jack under the front of the differential tilted it back

zzpn ax constellation ecn uoknor edu callison uokmax ecn uoknor edu james p callison writes in article apr michael apple com ems michael apple com e michael smith writes does it take any peculiar tools to remove the rear springs from a ford f truck this is a x with leaf springs front and rear so with a big socket and an air wrench and a floor jack and a hydrolic bottle jack can i do this at home i found that i needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks and a can of wd helped the sockets needed were metric exact fit but i was able to use some sae sockets and are rather close to and mm it can be fun having a canadian ford i m pictureing this undo u bolts put a bottle jack on the axle and raise the bed frame to take stress off of the leaf spring undo the end bolts bushings drop the spring turn the bottom leaf re connect the spring bolts sounds about right didn t have to undo the end bolts bushings just the u bolts on each side and the shock absorber jacking up the frame some more had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden platform on top of that to get the floor jack high enough to raise the frame i t one talll truck lifted the spring free of the axel taking out the block gave me enough room to undo the pin holding the spring pack together the spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head on the other end no wrench head vice grips worked fine i soaked the nut with wd and it came right off flipped the bottom spring and then is this a nightmare waiting to happen or an easy though physically demanding thing to do well it s easier than doing a decent trigger job on a a ok well maybe it s not that easy but it s not terribly difficult i donno i m a little more sore today than after working on a a a foot pipe cheater was a real help torque spec for the u bolt nuts is to ft lbs a a doesn t have that kind of torque spec it was a challenge to get the pack bolt back in the spring pack squeeze pack with two hands hold bolt with third put nut on with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth and sixth hands i used some string to tie the pack together while holding the pin in for alignment then i could let go to get the nut wrench vice grips getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too until i discovered that the axel had tilted and or rolled forward one the drivers side a bottle jack under the front of the differential tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right hole on the passenger side i had to wrestle the wheel into rolling forward about
